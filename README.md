# Find Queer Media

A web app to find queer media by type, characters, theme and whether or not it has a happy ending.

Data sources:

This is a gatsby set up where the extra data for queer finding is stored in json files under `/data`. The project then uses transformers to load in extra data from external sources.

- Books: `/data/books` (Google Books API)[https://developers.google.com/books]
- Movies: `/data/movies` (Open Movie Database)[https://www.omdbapi.com]
